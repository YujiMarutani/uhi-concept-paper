# Universal Human Infrastructure (UHI): Concept Paper v1.0

**Universal Human Infrastructure (UHI)** is a proposed institutional
architecture for post-labor societies. It reframes the policy problem
of automated economies from *income redistribution* to *access
architecture*: the systematic guarantee of the material, social, and
infrastructural conditions necessary for human flourishing.

This repository contains the full text of the **UHI Concept Paper v1.0**,
figures, and references. A DOI will be assigned via Zenodo upon release.

## 📘 Overview

UHI is structured as a **three-layer system**:

### **1. Infrastructure Layer — Automated Public Commons**
Energy, compute, logistics, and other large-scale technical systems
with near‑zero marginal cost characteristics.  
Funded by **strategic public investment**.

### **2. Support Layer — Universal Basic Services**
Healthcare, education, childcare, and housing as the foundation of
human capability.  
Funded by **broad-based taxation**.

### **3. Sovereign Layer — Self-Directed Human Activity**
A universal income floor enabling agency, non-market value creation,
and the *Right to Flourish*.  
Funded by **automation windfall redistribution**.

Together, these layers form a **post-labor social contract** in which
technological productivity is placed in service of human potential.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

### **1. Institutional Architecture**
A three-layer design that integrates infrastructure, services, and
income security into a unified system.

### **2. Economic Logic**
A multi-channel funding model aligned with the structural characteristics
of each layer:
- Public investment → Infrastructure  
- Broad taxation → Support  
- Automation windfall → Sovereign  

### **3. Normative Foundation**
The *Right to Flourish*: a positive freedom framework grounded in
capability theory, human uniqueness, and democratic legitimacy.

### **4. Civilizational Reframing**
UHI is not a welfare reform but a **civilization architecture** for
AI-driven economies.
