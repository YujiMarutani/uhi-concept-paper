## Abstract

The transition to an AI-driven economy challenges the labor-centered
social contract that has historically structured income distribution,
social legitimacy, and civic inclusion. As automation expands, productivity
gains increasingly accrue to capital while wage-based purchasing power
contracts, producing structural surplus concentration and systemic inequality.

This paper proposes Universal Human Infrastructure (UHI) as an institutional
framework for post-labor societies. UHI establishes a rights-based architecture
guaranteeing access to automated infrastructure, universal basic services,
and a universal income floor.

The framework is structured as three layers:

- **Infrastructure Layer** — automated public commons  
- **Support Layer** — universal basic services  
- **Sovereign Layer** — income security & self-directed activity  

The economic logic of UHI is grounded in automation windfall allocation,
aligning funding mechanisms with the structural characteristics of each layer.

Normatively, UHI is grounded in the **Right to Flourish**: the institutional
guarantee that every individual possesses the material and social conditions
necessary to realize their inherent potential independent of labor market status.

UHI is not a welfare reform but a civilization architecture for aligning
automation-driven prosperity with human flourishing.

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence represents a general-purpose technology capable of
substituting both cognitive and manual labor. As automation expands, labor-centered
mechanisms of income distribution weaken, decoupling productivity growth from
broad-based welfare.

Existing responses—including retraining and Universal Basic Income—address
symptoms but fail to provide an institutional architecture adequate to
post-labor conditions.

This paper introduces **Universal Human Infrastructure (UHI)** as a structural
framework ensuring access to the material, social, and infrastructural
conditions required for human flourishing.

---

## 2. Conceptual Framework

UHI reframes social policy from income redistribution to **access architecture**.
Human flourishing depends not only on income but on access to infrastructure,
services, and autonomous time.

The framework draws on the capability approach, emphasizing real freedoms
rather than resource transfers alone.

## 3. Three-Layer Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

UHI is structured as three mutually reinforcing layers:

- Infrastructure guarantees access  
- Support sustains capability  
- Sovereign protects freedom  

Each layer is necessary; none is sufficient alone.

---

### 3.2 Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides the automated public commons:
energy systems, compute infrastructure, communications networks,
and logistics chains.

These systems exhibit near-zero marginal cost characteristics at scale,
making universal access economically efficient.

Access to energy, compute, and connectivity is treated as a rights-bearing
domain necessary for agency in a technologically mediated society.

**Functions**

1. Provisioning essential systems  
2. Stabilizing social guarantees  
3. Amplifying productivity gains  

Funding: **strategic public investment**

---

### 3.3 Support Layer

The Support Layer provides universal basic services including healthcare,
education, childcare, and housing.

It ensures individuals can convert infrastructural access into real capability
and protects against life-course risks.

**Functions**

1. Capability formation  
2. Risk mitigation  
3. Social stabilization  

Funding: **broad-based taxation**

---

### 3.4 Sovereign Layer

The Sovereign Layer protects the domain of self-directed human activity.

A universal income floor funded by automation windfall redistribution
ensures material security independent of labor market participation.

**Functions**

1. Agency protection  
2. Non-market value enablement  
3. Free time as civilizational resource  

Funding: **automation windfall redistribution**

---

## 4. Economic Logic

Automation generates structural surplus through labor substitution,
compute-driven productivity, and capital concentration.

A three-channel funding architecture aligns revenue sources with
institutional functions:

- public investment → infrastructure  
- taxation → services  
- automation windfall → income floor  

This structure enhances fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability.

---

## 5. Ethical and Political Implications

UHI rejects labor-market participation as the primary criterion of social
legitimacy and recognizes non-market contributions as civilizational value.

It reframes free time not as unemployment but as a domain of human development.

---

## 6. The Right to Flourish

The Right to Flourish guarantees the material, social, and infrastructural
conditions necessary for individuals to realize their potential.

It extends beyond subsistence rights toward positive freedom and capability
development.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Universal Human Infrastructure provides an institutional architecture for
aligning technological productivity with human flourishing.

By guaranteeing infrastructure, services, and autonomy, UHI transforms
automation from a source of displacement into a foundation for a post-labor
civilization.
